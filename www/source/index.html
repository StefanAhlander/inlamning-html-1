            <article id="about">
                <h2>First a little about me</h2>
                <p>I was born in 1973 in Uppsala, Sweden. That makes me older than young.</p>
                <p>I had an early interest for computers and programing and still remember the Commodore VIC 20 my
                    father got me.
                    I also remember writing my first programs in BASIC. When the Commodore 64 was introduced I pleaded
                    with my
                    parents to get one. A neighbouring boy a few years older than me had gotten into assembler
                    programing
                    and it seemed like magic to me. I was hooked and was writng code almost all my spare time. I was
                    coding demos,
                    hacking BBS's and cracking copy protecion on games. Not everything was legal but computer security
                    was
                    not really a thing and the risk was low.
                </p>
                <p>When I got older I realised that girls at that time wasn't very much into computer geeks. I therefor
                    got into
                    martial arts instead and soon forgott about programing.
                </p>
                <p>Me teens and adolecent years were a bit messy but I finaly settled into law school. After graduating
                    with a degree in law
                    I worked different jobs and lived in Thailand for 18 months. Lately I worked for a law firm
                    specialized in criminal law.
                    I worked there for a year after which I switched to a small one man firm owned by a friend of mine.
                </p>
                <p>In 2013 I was diagnosed with chronic renal failure. The illness has been progressing slowly but it's
                    made me think about
                    my choices in life and about what I want to do when I grow up. The thoughts allways goes back to my
                    childhood passion
                    for programing. Of course nothing will be like a childhood passion but I can't help that I should
                    have made som different choices.
                    Because I believe it's never too late I have decided to make an effort to change my career.
